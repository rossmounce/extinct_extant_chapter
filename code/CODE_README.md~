This folder contains all the scripts you'll need to recreate the analysis pipeline used in this thesis chapter.

It is an update of the method used in:
[*Cobbett, A., Wilkinson, M., and Wills, M. (2007). Fossils impact as hard as living taxa in parsimony analyses of morphology. Systematic Biology, 56(5):753-766*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10635150701627296)


**Assumptions and pre-requisites**

1. This pipeline probably only works on Unix operating systems (Linux/Mac), I used Ubuntu 13.04
2. The cladistic data must be validly formatted for use with TNT
3. You must be able to call TNT from any terminal with 'tnt'
4. You must be able to call PAUP\* from any terminal with 'paup'
5. You must have R installed along with the package 'phangorn' and it's dependancies
6. All taxon-names must be unique in the first 10 characters e.g. *Crocodylus\_acutus* and *Crocodylus\_johnsoni* MUST be renamed as their first 10 characters are identical. (This pipeline makes use of PAUP\*'s PHYLIP tree-format export function which automatically truncates names to the first 10 characters)


**Analyzing a dataset**




The first script does the single taxon jackknife Max Parsimony analyses 
and spits out 'orig.nex' (with trees) and 'j01.nex' (with trees) ... files

#SECOND SCRIPT NOT TECHNICALLY NEEDED
The second script just converts the nex files (with matrix) into phylip tree files 
a.nexorg.tre + a.nex.1.tre ...   (Mainly just to be backwards compatible with DELBAT convention)

The third script reads in orig.nex, deletes taxa from trees, and spits out pruned-ref trees ref2.tre
IMPORTANT, numbering here starts from 2 because of PAUP numbering (1=outgroup)

The fourth script reads in all the j01.nex files and spits out treeset files jack1.tre
numbering here starts from 1 reflecting numbering of TNT (0=outgroup)

tnt tntdb.txt; paup -n paupcmds.txt; paup -n makerefs.txt; paup -n makejacks.txt;

then R CMD temp.R
