extinct_extant_chapter
======================

This is the data and code store for my 2013 thesis chapter on the impact of fossils in cladistic analyses.

The folder `dataset_analyses` contains all 75 cladistic datasets analysed for this chapter, along with the pruned reference tree files 'ref\*.tre', the jackknifed tree files 'jack\*.tre' and the summarised results for each dataset of the mean-minimum tree distance calculations as performed in *R* using the package *phagorn* within a .csv spreadsheet file.
